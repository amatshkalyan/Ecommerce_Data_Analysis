## Question 3

3.	How would you analyze the trend of cancel events from January 2022 to September 2023? Is it positive, negative, neutral? Please include how you would present your findings. You can use Google Sheets or Looker Studio but you donâ€™t have to. You can also just explain what visualization you would use and why.
